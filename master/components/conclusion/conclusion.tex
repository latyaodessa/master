\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{Conclusion and Future Work}

The novel cloud-based virtual community platform N2Sky, which allows to share and exchange neural network knowledge and computing resources, is presented. N2Sky today is tightly coupled with new technology, which aims to increase scalability, extensibility, portability and performance.

The scalable microservices architecture on infrastructure and application level is implemented. For the system administrator, the cloud environment monitoring is implemented. Additionally, the customized alerting system helps to control environment without constant monitoring by human.  

It has a modern, user-friendly user interface and gives positive user experience. The N2Sky platform was tested on desktop PCs, mobile devices and tables. Because design is user-oriented, the workflow of processing step-by-step actions was easy for all types of users. 

There are already packaged solutions located in neural network repository and models respository, which can be easily reused in own project. The creation of own neural network from existing paradigm is possible via the N2Sky user interface without deep knowledge in neural network field.

New ViNNSL template format gave the contributors a new and simple way how to describe and set all needed data about neural network into one file. The ViNNSL template is dynamic and extandable and it can be modified on the one side and it will be reflected automatically across all N2Sky services. 

In the future, N2Sky can be extended from neural network domain to arbitrary machine learning. Hereby the ViNNSL template extension and scalable microservices N2Sky architecture can be useful for future work.
