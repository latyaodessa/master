\section{Requirements specification for Administration Module}\label{Administration components}

\subsection{General Definition}\label{General Definition AMC}

Administration Module Component (AMC) is an application, which is responsible for managing OpenStack and Cloudify. It embeds Monitoring System and Alert Management System. AMC is integrated into N2Sky cloud platform in order to support N2Sky environment and services. This component is implementing Platform as a service approach, hence it can be installed on any cloud server. 

\subsection{Affected users}\label{Affected users}

The users, who have full knowledge about the domain with corespondent permissions or domain owner can have an access to AMC.

In N2Sky only System Administrator has a proper main function in order to manage AMC.
Following functions are available for System Administrator:
\begin{itemize}
\item Mange own dashboard view
\item Control OpenStack Dashboard and its services
\item Control Cloudify Dashboard and its services
\item Manage monitoring charts
\item Manage alerts and alerting rules
\item Managed OpenStack instances (servers)
\item Has an access to dashboards of other users
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Administration Dashboard}\label{Administration Dashboard}

Administration Dashboard represents the overview of administration tools and important metrics, which is displayed in ``Fig.~\ref{fig:admin_dashboard}''. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/admin_dashboard.png}
  \caption{N2Sky Administration Dashboard.}
  \label{fig:admin_dashboard}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

After System Administrator login into the system, he will be automatically redirected to Administration Dashboard. By default URL link is:
\begin{lstlisting}
        <host>/cloud
\end{lstlisting}

Administration tools have to be in focus of main dashboard view as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:admin_tools}. The collection of elements has to be under the title bar element, which has named "ADMINISTRATION TOOLS". Every element of administration tool has to contain icon in SVG \cite{Cagle2005} format and caption under it. Following administration tools have to be represented: 
\begin{itemize}
\item OpenStack Dashboard. Link to view: 
\begin{lstlisting}
        <host>/openstack
\end{lstlisting}
\item Cloudify Dashboard. Link to view: 
\begin{lstlisting}
        <host>/cloudify
\end{lstlisting}
\item Alert Management System. Link to view: 
\begin{lstlisting}
        <host>/alert
\end{lstlisting}
\item Dashboards Settings. Modal popup window without redirection
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/admin_tools.png}
  \caption{N2Sky Administration Dashboard. Administration tools component.}
  \label{fig:admin_tools}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Next, to administration tools, the monitoring charts are showing. The title of this block is "FEATURED METRICS", which is the title bar upon the metrics.
Every chart is a grid item element, the grit itself has to contain maximum two grit items in one row as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:featured_metrics}. 
 
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/featured_metrics.png}
  \caption{N2Sky Administration Dashboard. Featured Metrics component.}
  \label{fig:featured_metrics}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
 
 
The user decides by himself which monitoring charts will be shown. The configuration is located in "Dashboard Settings" administration tool element. More details about the creation of monitoring charts are located in \autoref{Monitoring System}. 


\subsection{Openstack Dashboard}\label{OpenStack Dashboard}

OpenStack Dashboard is the dashboard for managing OpenStack and its services and monitoring OpenStack and its instances. It looks similar to Administration Dashboard, except it is the only OpenStack oriented and there are no additional tools as it is shown in  figure \ref{fig:openstack_dashboard}. 

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/openstack_dashboard.png}
  \caption{N2Sky OpenStack Dashboard.}
  \label{fig:openstack_dashboard}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
 

This dashboard contains two blocks:

\begin{description}
\item[Project grid.] This block contains projects, which are available on OpenStack as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:openstack_dashboard_projects}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/openstack_dashboard_projects.png}
  \caption{N2Sky OpenStack Dashboard. Projects grid}
  \label{fig:openstack_dashboard_projects}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Every grid item represents a brief overview of OpenStack Project:

\begin{itemize}
\item Name of the project, which is the header of grid item.
\item ID of the project.
\item Enabled, which stays if available (value YES) or not available (value NO).
\item Is a domain, also contains simple yes or no values.
\item Parent, which says if there any parent project which is current project linked.
\item Button "Open Project", which redirects to project details.
\end{itemize}

\item[Monitoring Grid.] Similar to Administration Dashboard monitoring grid can be customized by users. Detail information about customization is written in \autoref{Monitoring System}. 

\end{description}

After redirecting to project details the user will see information about the specific project. Redirection should hast following URL path: 
\begin{lstlisting}
        <host>/openstack/project/<id>
\end{lstlisting}

Where <id> is OpenStack project ID.

\subsubsection{OpenStack Nova Service}\label{OpenStack Nova Service}

Nova is a compute service of OpenStack. I give overview and managing of all existing virtual machine (servers or instances) \cite{Markelov2016}. 

Following tools for using compute service:
\begin{itemize}
\item Horizon. Web UI for managing OpenStack projects. It is not used in the N2Sky system since N2Sky Web UI has its own interface for managing the OpenStack instances.
\item OpenStack Client, which includes commands for Nova as well as for OpenStack projects.
\item Nova Client, which can be used like OpenStack Client, but N2Sky does not use it since OpenStack Client can provide all needed commands for nova service. 
\end{itemize}


OpenStack project view has detailed description about server and its instances as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:openstack_dashboard_projects}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

  \label{fig:openstack_server_details}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{OpenStack Neutron Service}\label{OpenStack Neutron Service}

Neutron is an OpenStack networking service, which provides "network connectivity as a service". Neutron is fully integrated into OpenStack UI, which allows managing networking directly from there. The networking service is based on quantum architecture, where API clients communicate with virtual switches through Quantum APU and Quantum plugin \cite{neutron}. This service implements Neutron API, which is used by N2Sky Web UI. 

Neutron Service is integrated into N2Sky and represents the overview of networks, subnet pools, and services providers as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:openstack_neutron}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/openstack_neutron.png}
  \caption{N2Sky OpenStack Dashboard. Neutron Service View}

\end{description}


\subsubsection{OpenStack Images Service}\label{OpenStack Images Service}

In OpenStack is possible to upload customized images of the Virtual Machine to the provider. N2Sky uses Images Service only for representation of images information. It also possible to download an image, but it is not possible to upload customized image due expensive process, because of the size of images. It is possible to use template provider with pre-configured virtual machine \cite{images}. 


\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/openstack_images.png}
  \caption{N2Sky OpenStack Dashboard. Images Service View}
  \label{fig:openstack_images}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The Image Service view, which shown in ``Fig.~\ref{fig:openstack_images}'' is representing a grid of available images. Every grid item contains the following information: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Name of the image
\item Description of the image

\end{itemize}

N2Sky templates and configuration has to support following operating systems:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ubuntu 14.04 / 16.04 
\item Debian 8
\item Centos
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{OpenStack Vitrage Service}\label{OpenStack Vitrage Service}

Vitrage is the OpenStack RCA (Root Cause Analysis) service. Is a build in the monitoring system, which helps to analyze and organize OpenStack alarms and events \cite{wiki:vitrage}. In the N2Sky platform, Vitrage service is used only for representation of templates and resources because N2Sky has its own Monitoring System, which can be propagated in all OpenStack instances.  

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/opentack_vitrage.png}
  \caption{N2Sky OpenStack Dashboard. Vitrage Service View}
  \label{fig:opentack_vitrage}

\end{description}



\subsection{Cloudify Dashboard}\label{Cloudify Dashboard}

\hl{TODO ????}

\subsection{Dashboard Settings}\label{Dashboard Settings}
As it was mentioned before in Administration Dashboard chapter \autoref{Administration Dashboard}, the dashboard has the administration tools. One of this tools is Dashboard Settings tool. When the user clicks on this tool the modal popup window will open and available configuration options will appear as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:openstack_template}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/dashboard_settings.png}
  \caption{N2Sky Administration Dashboard. Dashboard Settings}
  \label{fig:dashboard_settings}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Another one possibility to initiate settings popup is to open it from the main navigation menu, which is available across an entire application on the left screen of the page view. 

Dashboard Settings popup contains two setting for now:
\begin{itemize}
\item Create OpenStack Monitoring Dashlet, which create one more modal popup upon existing and initialize creation monitoring chart, which is described in chapter "Monitoring System" in \autoref{Monitoring System}.
\item Create an Alert, which also creates one more modal popup upon existing and initialize creation alerting rule, which is described in chapter "Alert System" in \autoref{Alerting System}.
\end{itemize}

The popup will be automatically closed only after action performed if action is not performed user can leave the popup manually.



\subsection{Monitoring System}\label{Monitoring System}

When Administration Dashboard in general shows overview of the OpenStack and Cloudify, the monitoring system goes through every dashboard an apply monitoring chars on user request. There are two main parts, which has to be mentioned in FRS: displaying of monitoring charts and management of metrics.
 
\subsubsection{Monitoring charts creation}\label{Monitoring charts creation}

After user initializes creation of monitoring metrics at it was described in \autoref{Dashboard Settings} "Dashboard Settings", a new modal window will be opened as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:create_monitoring}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/create_monitoring.png}
  \caption{N2Sky Administration Dashboard. Monitoring charts creation modal popup}
  \label{fig:create_monitoring}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The popup window has following elements:

\begin{enumerate}
\item "CREATE NEW DASHLET" title of the popup
\item Combobox with servers, where monitoring system instance is installed. The user can choose all available instances, even if they are not running currently. It is also possible to choose OpenStack cloud server itself because monitoring system instance is preinstalled there.
\item Combobox with views.  The user can choose where combo box will be added. There are few places where chart can be displayed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Administration Dashboard
\item OpenStack Dashboard
\item Cloudify Dashboard
\item Servers (OpenStack instances) View. 
\end{enumerate}
\item Combobox with metrics. Normally it is more than hundred of available metrics. It is important to mention that every operating system has different naming of metrics.
\item Delay input. This input shows the delayed time of metric.
\item Step input. This input shows the line chart step of chosen metric
\item Timing combo box. This combo box contains following time options:
\begin{enumerate}
\item seconds
\item minutes
\item hours
\item days
\item weeks
\end{enumerate}
\item Create button, which triggers metrics creation. The view will be reloaded and monitoring chart will appear in this view.
\end{enumerate}

After adding a new monitoring chart, the view will be reloaded and the chart will appear on the view. 

\subsubsection{Monitoring charts representation}\label{Monitoring chart representation}

Every monitoring chart is a grid item of two column responsive grid as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:moniroting_representation}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/moniroting_representation.png}
  \caption{N2Sky Administration Dashboard. Monitoring charts representation}
  \label{fig:moniroting_representation}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The grid has to be responsive in order to support mobile devices. When the mobile device is detected the grid should have only one column and grid items have to be aligned vertically. 

The header of monitoring chart has to contain the name of the metrics and the server (instance) from where this metrics comes.

Every monitoring chart has at list one line graph with a random color. If there are few line graphs in the chart, then lines have to have a different color. A chart contains on X-axis the timestamp and on y-Axis the velocity.  The timestamp in line graph has its own toolkit with additional information about the chart and contains following data:

\begin{itemize}
\item Timestamp of event
\item Type of metrics and Id of timestamp
\item Instance, where monitoring system is running
\item The name of the job, which is responsible for particular event
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Alert System}\label{Alerting System}

Alert System hat it is own page view. It is possible to redirect to this view from main navigation menu as well as from administration dashboard. The URL of the alert page is:
\begin{lstlisting}
        <host>/alert
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Alerting rule creation}\label{Alerting rule creation}

It is possible to alert rule directly from alert page view. The button "Create Alert" initiate the modal popup window as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:alert_create}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/alert_create.png}
  \caption{N2Sky Administration Dashboard. Alerting rule creation}
  \label{fig:alert_create}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The modal window has following elements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Modal window title is "Create new alert".
\item Combobox with available servers with the installed monitoring system.
\item Combobox with a page view, where an alert can be shown (optional).
\item Combobox with an available metrics.
\item Combobox with alerting rule severity level. Three values are possible: "page" for information, "waring" and "critical".
\item Summary information about alerting rule.
\item Full description about alerting rule.
\item Expression which will be executed against chosen metric.
\item Period, which shows how often will alerting rule validated.
\end{enumerate}



\subsubsection{Alerts representation}\label{Alerts representation}

The alerts are displayed three column grid as it is shown in figure \ref{fig:alert_representation}'' 

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{components/4/pics/alert_representation.png}
  \caption{N2Sky Administration Dashboard. Alerts representation}
  \label{fig:alert_representation}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The view contains:

\begin{description}
\item[Header.] Header is navigation bar with a title "Fired alerts" and the button. The button has the caption "Create Alert" and on click will initiate creating alert rule popup as it described in \autoref{Alerting rule creation} "Alerting rule creation".
\item[Alerts Grid] Contains 3 columns of alerts. When alert end date is earlier than current date, then alert will not be shown. Only active alerts are visible. Detailed information about alert content is described in \autoref{Alerting Management System} "Alerting Management System".
\end{description}
