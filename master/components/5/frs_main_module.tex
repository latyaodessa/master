Main Application Module (MAM) is an application, which responsible for management N2Sky system. It embeds:
\begin{itemize}
\item Model Repository 
\item Neural Network Repository 
\item N2Sky Main Dashboard.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Affected users}\label{Affected users MAM}
The MAM has one User Interface but users can use it diverse. Only users, which main function is within MAM can operate this module on their own purpose. Following types of users have this kind of main function:
\begin{description}
\item[Consumer.] The main function of consumer is to learn about neural networks or try out his knowledge in this field. Detailed description is in \autoref{User Roles}.
