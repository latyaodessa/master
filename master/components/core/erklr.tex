\section*{Acknowledgements}

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Mr. Univ.-Prof. tit. Univ.-Prof. Dipl.-Ing. Dr. Erich Schikuta. The door to Prof. Schikuta office was always open whenever I ran into a trouble spot or had a question about my research or writing. 

I would also like to acknowledge to collaborators of the Workflow Systems and Technology research group at University of Vienna for helping me with the cloud environment. 

Finally, I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents and to my friend Mersi Stafa for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement through the process of researching and writing this thesis.
