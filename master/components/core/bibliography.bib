abstract="In an administrator perspective, a system repair is a tedious work because a server can be down any time, even at night. In addition, it takes some time to repair and bring the server back online. Therefore, a self-healing server is needed to decrease workload of an administrator. Nagios is open source monitoring tools and is normally used for monitoring networks, servers or applications. In this work, a self-healing function in Nagios is proposed in order to automatically solve Linux server problems. Nagios is used for both monitoring and solving problems in Apache web servers and Oracle database servers, which were analyzed using a root cause analysis. Two scenarios, a practical scenario and a simulated problem scenario, are tested with number of corrections and time to solve problems as performance metrics. The experimental results showed that the time to solve problems using self-healing approach for Apache web servers was improved 31.42{\%} and that for Oracle database servers was improved 40.40{\%} comparing with manual solving approach.",

abstract="Messaging, and distributed transactions, describe two important models for building enterprise software systems. Distributed object middleware aims to support both models by providing messaging and transaction services. But while the concept of distributed object transactions is well-understood, support for messaging in distributed object environments is still in its early stages, and not nearly as readily perceived. Integrating messaging into distributed object environments, and in particular with distributed object transactions, describes a novel and complex software design problem. This paper details this problem, presenting first results from our project of developing a messaging and transaction integration facility. The first contribution of this paper is a comprehensive messaging classification framework, which defines messaging concepts and terminology, and enables us to compare different messaging architectures. Second, we analyze sample messaging middleware using this framework, and identify the architectural messaging styles that they induce. Third, we derive four different strategies for integrating messaging and distributed object transactions. We discuss each of these integration strategies, and outline the open research issues that need to be solved. Overall, this paper advances our understanding of the motivation for, the problems of, the current state-of-the-art in, and future models for integrating messaging and distributed object transactions.",

abstract="Responsible architecture design is believed to be the most effective answer to the incompatibility problem of webpages across devices with varying sizes and resolutions. Online shopping behavior is cross-device and continuous; therefore, we believe that it is also important to explore and discuss how to provide a fluent and consistent user experience for the same webpage across various devices (other than simply using the fluid grid technique to maintain cross device compatibility). Inspired by the fluency theory, we assume that the fluency of processing webpages on different devices affects a user's responsive web experience. In this paper, a case study of etao.com was performed to explore how to improve user experience fluency with responsive web design on mobile phones. The study consisted of two experiments: a PC test and a mobile phone test. The PC test was designed to understand the interactions between the users and the information content on etao.com (desktop version), which could facilitate the identification of user preferences and expectations and guide the design layout of the responsive webpage on mobile phones. During the mobile phone test, we examined the responsive webpage, which was designed according to users' preferences and expectations, to determine whether this type of layout could be approved by users. The results showed that users rated the new version of the responsive webpage higher than the traditional responsive page, which was designed by using proportion-based fluid grid technology alone.",

An example of such systems is represented by multi-device applications, where the user can interact with the system through different platforms. However, providing end-users with real capabilities to author user interfaces is still a problematic issue, which is beyond the ability of most end-users today. In this paper, we present an approach intended to enable users to modify Web interfaces easily, considering implicit user intents inferred from example interface modifications carried out by the user. We discuss the design issues involved in the implementation of such an intelligent approach, also reporting on some experimental results obtained from a user test.",

abstract="User Interface (UI) design remains an open, wicked, complex and multi-faceted problem, owing to the ever increasing variability of design options resulting from multiple contexts of use, i.e., various end-users, heterogeneous devices and computing platforms, as well as their varying environments. Designing multiple UIs for multiple contexts of use inevitably requires an ever growing amount of time and resources that not all organizations are able to afford. Moreover, UI design choices stand on end-users' needs elicitation, which are recognized to be difficult to evaluate precisely upfront and which require iterative design cycles. All this complex variability should be managed efficiently to maintain time and resources to an acceptable level. To address these challenges, this article proposes a variability management approach integrated into a UI rapid prototyping process, which involves the combination of Model-Driven Engineering, Software Product Lines and Interactive Genetic Algorithms.",

abstract="Multimedia applications are a branch of software development with growing importance. Typical application areas are training applications and simulations, infotainment systems -- e.g. in cars -- or computer games. However, there is still a lack of tailored concepts for a structured development of this kind of application. The current paper proposes a modeling approach for the user interface of multimedia applications with the goal of a model-driven development. We identify the special properties of multimedia application development and the resulting aspects to be covered by the user interface model. Existing conventional user interface modeling approaches are not sufficient, as they do not cover the media-specific aspects of the application. However, a multimedia application usually includes conventional user interface elements as well. Thus, we first propose a solution for the media-specific part. Second, we elaborate an integration of our approach with existing conventional approaches. Finally, we discuss the overall model-driven development approach and outline its benefits.",
